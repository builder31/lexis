        Welcome to the Native Project. This is a modest attempt at preserving information on indigenous cultures throughout the world. We are currently in the process of compiling a lexicon of endangered and extinct languages both within and outside of North America. If you are interested in the information currently available or if you would like to contribute, please contact us.
